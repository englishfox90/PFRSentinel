"""Tests for the capture-control handler seam (Stage 0c).

The highest-severity risk in the control API is a request thread touching Qt
state. These tests pin the two halves of the mitigation:

* the GUI bridge queues onto the GUI thread rather than executing inline, so a
  call from an HTTP thread never runs ``start_capture()`` there;
* the headless handler only flips a ``threading.Event``, which needs no
  marshalling at all.
