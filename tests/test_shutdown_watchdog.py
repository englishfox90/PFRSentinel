"""Force-exit watchdog tests.

The watchdog exists to guarantee the process actually dies when shutdown wedges
(a hung teardown step leaves a locked exe that fails the next in-place upgrade).
The kill path is verified in a subprocess so it can't take the test runner down;
idempotency is checked in-process with a harmless long timeout.
