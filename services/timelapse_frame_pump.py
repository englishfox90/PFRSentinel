"""
Bounded single-consumer frame queue that decouples a fast producer (the GUI
thread delivering captured frames) from a slow consumer (RGB conversion +
blocking ffmpeg stdin write).

Generic on purpose — it knows nothing about timelapses or ffmpeg. It exists
because ``TimelapseWriter.add_frame`` used to do the conversion and the
blocking ``stdin.write`` inline on the caller's thread (the GUI thread, via
the Qt signal chain), which meant a wedged encoder stalled the whole event
loop. Producer calls must return immediately; a full queue drops the OLDEST
item rather than blocking the producer or refusing the newest one.
