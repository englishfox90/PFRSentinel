"""
Resolve a ZWO camera's current SDK index from its stored identity.

The saved index is only a hint — it shifts whenever any USB camera appears or
drops. We re-enumerate and match on the model name, refusing to guess when the
identity is unknown and the choice is ambiguous. This previously auto-selected
"the first camera" whenever no name was stored, which hijacked a user's guide
camera after a config reset (June 2026).

This resolves a *starting* index only. The hardware serial is the authoritative
key but requires opening the camera, so the final serial-checked decision is
made in the connection layer (CameraConnection.connect serial-verifies and
reconnect_safe probes serials). Same-model ambiguity here is therefore safe:
connect() rejects the wrong body and the serial probe finds the right one.
