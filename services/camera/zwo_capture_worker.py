"""ZWO camera capture worker.

Holds the single-frame capture routine and the long-running capture loop with
reconnect/backoff logic. Split out of services/zwo_camera.py to keep both
files under the project size cap. Functions take a ZWOCamera instance and
operate on its attributes — they are not standalone; they rely on the camera's
connection, calibration manager, and callbacks.
