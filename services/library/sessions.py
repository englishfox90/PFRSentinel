"""
Image library session grouping.

Aggregates archived frames into observing 'nights' for the Library UI. A night
is the natural unit an operator thinks in: frames from local noon to the next
local noon belong to the same night, so an evening-to-morning run is never split
at midnight. Pure read-side logic over the index — no file I/O — so it stays
unit-testable without disk or Qt.

The condition band shown on the session cards and the night scrubber is driven
by per-frame ``status``:
  • clear  — roof open + clear sky   (green)
  • cloudy — roof open + not clear   (amber)
  • closed — roof closed             (red)
  • gap    — a stretch with no captured frames (dark / hatched)
  • unknown — no roof/sky/weather signal stored for the frame (grey)
Roof + sky come from the ML service (when ``ml_models.enabled``); cloud cover
from the weather service is the fallback for "clear" when the sky model is N/A.
