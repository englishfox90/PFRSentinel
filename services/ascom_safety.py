ASCOM Safety Monitor File Writer

Writes ML predictions to a file format compatible with NINA's GenericFile Safety Monitor.
This allows PFR Sentinel's ML-based roof detection to integrate with observatory automation.

File format example (configurable preamble/triggers):
    Roof Status: OPEN
    Confidence: 95%
    Sky Condition: Clear

NINA GenericFile Setup:
    - File to monitor: path to this file
    - Preamble: "Roof Status:"
    - Safe trigger: "OPEN"
    - Unsafe trigger: "CLOSED"
