Sub-pixel star centroid detection for all-sky camera calibration.

Uses OpenCV blob detection followed by weighted-moment refinement
to achieve ~0.3px centroid accuracy on moderately bright stars.

Sky circle auto-detection
-------------------------
All-sky fisheye images have a circular sky region surrounded by black
corners. ``estimate_sky_circle()`` detects that circle automatically
so detections are restricted to the actual sky, avoiding equipment,
buildings and corner noise.  ``detect_stars()`` calls it automatically
when no sky circle is supplied.  ``measure_sky_circle()`` is the same
measurement without the frame-centred fallback (returns None instead) for
callers that must not mistake an assumed radius for a measured one.

    The fisheye lens produces a circular illuminated region surrounded by

      1. Percentile stretch (p1 -> 0, p99 -> 255) so the threshold below is
         relative to the frame's own brightness range rather than absolute
      2. Heavy Gaussian blur — suppresses stars, planets, equipment

      6. Algebraic circle fit to recover the true (possibly off-centre) optical centre
      7. Inward trim by trim_fraction to exclude horizon buildings/equipment
