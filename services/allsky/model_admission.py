"""
Admission of a candidate calibration model against the incumbent.

The per-model gates (lens polynomial, a1 vs sky circle, bright anchors,
match count) judge a candidate on its own. This module judges it against
what is already known about the rig, which fixes the failure mode from
issue #10 (2026-09): a contaminated pole measurement vetoed a converged,
anchor-passing model 16 times in one night, while the seedless "basin
escape" that the vetoes triggered produced wrong-scale candidates
(a1 ≈ 1008–1044 against a true ~1283) that passed every per-model gate and
were only kept out by that same untrustworthy pole check.

Authority follows evidence. An incumbent may constrain its replacement only
to the extent something other than its own fit vouched for it — the
per-model gates demonstrably do not separate the wrong-scale basin (the #10
escape candidates passed all of them), so an incumbent that was admitted on
"no pole estimate — check skipped" has no standing to lock anything. The
first cut of this module let any gate-passing incumbent lock mirror and
scale, which turned a wrong-scale cold-start fit into a permanent lockout:
the correct model was rejected as "1.25x the incumbent's plate scale" on
every later run, no matter how much evidence arrived with it.

Trust ladder, highest first. `FisheyeModel.provenance` records the rung:

1. GUIDED ('guided') — solved from user-identified anchors, or admitted as
   the same basin as such a model. Defines the basin: a replacement must
   keep its mirror, its plate scale and project the celestial pole where
   the incumbent does; the measured pole is advisory (logged, never a
   veto). The user's clicks outrank a pole measured from a field of
   tracking-mount lights — on the #10 rig the guided solve (RMS 2.4 px,
   a1 = 1269) and the vetoed refinements (a1 = 1283) agreed to 1.1 %.
2. POLE-CORROBORATED ('pole') — admitted while a trusted measured pole
   (pole_consensus) confirmed where it projects the pole, or admitted as
   the same basin as such a model. Locks mirror, scale and basin exactly
   as a guided model does, for as long as nothing better is known. When a
   trusted pole is available on a later run, that fresh measurement
   outranks the incumbent's older one: a candidate that passes the pole
   gate is admitted and any continuity conflict is logged, so a model
   corroborated by a stable contaminant can still be displaced once the
   genuine pole is measured. The one exception is the mirror when the
   current pole has no repeated rotation vote — then the incumbent's
   verified mirror is the only mirror evidence and still binds.
   The rung AGES: it is honoured only while the pole has been trusted
   within the last POLE_AUTHORITY_MAX_UNTRUSTED_RUNS recorded runs. The
   stamp is persisted, but the evidence behind it is a measurement of the
   field, and a camera repositioned during maintenance (a documented event
   on this project's own rig) into an orientation where Polaris is hidden
   would otherwise reject the correct new-geometry bootstrap as "different
   basin" against an incumbent nothing has vouched for since the move —
   every escape, forever. The horizon is the pole history length: once
   nothing in the history corroborates the field any more, the incumbent's
   corroboration is off the record too. It is reversible — the next
   trusted pole resets the count and the stamp binds again.
3. UNCORROBORATED ('' — automatic fit admitted without a trusted pole,
   Calibrate Now without one, or a legacy file) — inherits nothing. The
   candidate is gated by the measured pole alone, and only when
   pole_consensus trusts one. Two uncorroborated fits at different scales
   are symmetric ignorance; neither may veto the other. An uncorroborated
   incumbent climbs to rung 2 in place the first time a trusted pole
   confirms where it projects the pole (incumbent_evidence
   .corroborate_incumbent, run by the refine worker before admission) —
   it does not have to wait for a candidate to be admitted on its behalf.

Plate-scale continuity: SCALE_CONTINUITY_MAX_DEV = 10 %. Same-rig fits agree
far closer than that — guided vs refined on the #10 rig 1.011, bootstrap vs
truth on the reference rig 0.993 — while the wrong-scale escape candidates
sat at 0.79–0.81 and the incident model at 0.51. Ten percent is nine times
the observed same-basin spread and leaves nine points of margin to the
nearest wrong-scale fit ever observed.

Pole continuity between two models reuses POLE_TOL_REF_PX (140 px scaled):
the same generous "regional model error at the pole" tolerance the measured
pole gate uses — two good fits of one rig differ by 15–90 px there (P5
validation), wrong basins by 400–1400 px.

The admit_* functions stamp `candidate.provenance` on admission, because
admission is where the evidence is weighed: that stamp is what gives the
model its authority as the next incumbent.
