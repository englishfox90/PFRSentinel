"""
Background QThread workers for CalibrationService.

Extracted from calibration_service.py (which re-exports both classes and
MAX_RESIDUAL_PX for existing callers).

Ownership contract — both classes are created UNPARENTED and retired by the
service on QThread.finished:

  * Neither exposes a signal named ``finished``. A same-named Signal on a
    QThread subclass shadows QThread.finished in Python, and QThread.finished
    is the only hook that tells the owner a run is over. Shadowing it is what
    made every worker leak. Results arrive on ``result_ready`` / ``failed``.
  * ``release()`` drops the payload the worker pinned for the duration of the
    run (a frame buffer, a full-resolution image copy).
