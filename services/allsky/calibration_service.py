"""
Background calibration accumulation service.

Receives frames from the image processing pipeline, detects stars,
accumulates detection data, and progressively refines the fisheye lens
model through multi-image joint calibration.

Lifecycle:
  1. Created by AllSkyController on startup.
  2. Loads existing model from %LOCALAPPDATA%/PFRSentinel/allsky_calibration.json.
  3. Fed by ImageProcessorWorker via feed_frame() on each captured frame.
  4. Detects stars inline (~50 ms), stores detection data (not raw images).
  5. When enough frames span enough time, launches a background _RefineWorker.
  6. On success, saves improved model and emits quality_upgraded signal.

Thread safety:
  - feed_frame() is called from the image-processor worker thread.
  - _maybe_refine() runs on the main thread (via queued signal).
  - _RefineWorker runs in its own QThread.

Worker ownership:
  Workers are created UNPARENTED and retired via QThread.finished (see
  _retire_worker). Parenting them to this long-lived service made Shiboken
  keep every past QThread alive, each pinning its payload — measured at
  477 MB after ten refinements, ~2.2 GB over a night on the reference rig.
