Does a completed automatic fit replace the incumbent model?

model_admission decides whether a candidate is *admissible* — the right
mirror, scale and basin for the rig. This module decides the separate
question CalibrationService asks once a candidate has been admitted: is it
a better model than the one on disk? The two are kept apart because they
weigh different things: admission weighs evidence about the rig, replacement
weighs fit quality — and fit quality alone is exactly what the #10
wrong-scale escapes had plenty of.

Rules, in order:

1. No incumbent: any admitted model is an upgrade from "no model".
2. Basin escape ON EVIDENCE: replace without the RMS guard. The escape ran
   because refinements seeded by the incumbent kept failing, and the
   candidate was admitted against something real — continuity with an
   authoritative incumbent, or a trusted measured pole. The incumbent's own
   (possibly flattering) RMS is what is in doubt and must not veto it.
   An escape with NO evidence — uncorroborated incumbent, no trusted pole —
   gets no such bypass and falls through to the normal comparison. Every
   pre-provenance installation loads its calibration uncorroborated, and
   three refinement failures on a hazy night are routine: a seedless
   bootstrap over a partly clouded buffer can produce a wrong-scale
   candidate that passes every per-model gate (the #10 a1≈1008–1044
   family), and with no evidence to admit it on, unconditional replacement
   would save that over a working model. The candidate can still win when
   it is genuinely better on the numbers, so a wrong cold-start model is
   not a permanent lock either — but "better" has a floor: the RMS must be
   at least ESCAPE_MIN_RMS_GAIN lower with at least as many matches, and a
   quality-rank upgrade alone does not count. An escape result is by
   construction a different basin from the incumbent; on 2026-09-05 one
   was installed over a correct model on 8.03 vs 8.04 px (828 vs 767
   matches), a margin that is noise between two fits of one lens. Two
   uncorroborated fits are symmetric ignorance and a coin-flip RMS must
   not decide between them.
3. Basin escape over an incumbent that FAILED the bright-anchor gate:
   replace, whatever the RMS says. CalibrationService only lets an escape
   run when the incumbent misses the bright stars on the recent frames — a
   healthy incumbent cancels it in _maybe_refine — and the candidate was
   admitted having passed that same gate on those same frames. A model
   that cannot find the bright stars has no standing to veto on RMS one
   that can. Without this rule the guard below reads the incumbent's RMS
   first and the escape can never land: on the #33 rig a single-image fit
   to five stars (2.43 px, 8 parameters over 5 points) turned away a
   726-match joint fit 41 times in one night. This does not reopen
   2026-09-05 — that incumbent PASSED the anchor gate, so the escape was
   cancelled before any candidate existed. Anchor health is tri-state: an
   obstructed or cloudy buffer reports None, which is not a failure and
   changes nothing here.
4. Guided single-solve incumbent vs a multi-image candidate: rank only. The
   guided solve's RMS is over a handful of clicked anchors, a joint fit's is
   over thousands of matches across the sky — not comparable — and the
   joint fit is the better whole-sky model (ALLSKY_CALIBRATION_PLAN:
   multi-3h beat the 9-anchor V5 fit despite the higher reported RMS). The
   candidate was admitted as the same basin, so a rank upgrade is enough.
   Once replaced, both sides carry joint RMS and rule 5 applies again.
5. Otherwise the RMS guard, but only where the incumbent's RMS is a
   measurement: reject if more than 15 % worse by RMS — a quality-rank
   upgrade is not sufficient justification for overwriting a precise model
   (a 15–20 px model used to overwrite a 3 px one just by accumulating
   frames) — and then require either a rank upgrade or a strict improvement
   (lower RMS with at least as many matches). An incumbent fitted to a
   handful of matches in a single image reports a residual that is
   interpolation rather than measurement (see COMPARABLE_MIN_MATCHES), and
   such a number binds nothing: the guard and the escape floor are skipped
   and rank or strict improvement decides. 2026-09-05's incumbent had 767
   matches over 40 images, so the guard still binds there.
